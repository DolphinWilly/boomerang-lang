HARMONY SUMMER PLANS

Initial assignment:
  1) read harmony papers
  2) write address book lens from talk (together)
  3) get Safari working again

Major issues: 
  - finding more easy demos
  - getting the implementation really going

* Finishing Focal compiler (Nate)
    - no more research on lenses right now!
    - performance tuning
    - (eventually, replace backend with sheaves)
* Simple(!) user interface
* Unison integration
* Many demos
    - easy ones: bookmarks (first); bibtex (XML only!); 
      simple structured text?; iTunes? generic HTML/XML? bibtex?
        - simple XML file formats
        - no alignment issues
        - no fancy lens primitives
        - modest amounts of data
    - hard ones: 
        - calendar (make alignment into a lens!) 
          check out IETF Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group!
          redo alignment stuff as lenses
          reimplement in Focal
          however: very probably better not to deal with non-XML data at all!
                   (conversion to and from XML should be an external process, and
                    Harmony itself should not help)
          GROUP calendar demo
        - address book (vcard-ish)
        - but make sure these don't get on the critical path!
    - maybe some of the driver scripts should be written in Perl/Python
* Packaging and configuration
    - delete ./configure stuff
    - remove graphical stuff from makefile defaults
    - delete optometrist and related crust
    - no backups
* Documentation
    - documentation of lenses should be generated from source code (both ocaml
      and focal)

__________________________________________________________________________

IMMEDIATE
* 'make clean' in src directory tries to redo 'configure'!
* We should throw away all this 'configure' stuff anyway and call out to
  tidy as an external program
* renaming: hoist becomes hoist_unique

PENDING DONE
* Add ICal, ICalendar and PalmDatebook
   - Requires dealing correctly with alignment
   -[this is done right? (AS or BCP confirm?)]

BUILD
* make clean should remove the silly ._d directories
* 'make clean' in src directory tries to redo 'configure'!
* We should throw away all this 'configure' stuff anyway and call out to
  tidy as an external program

TIDYING
* Add interfaces everywhere
* Remove remote execution stuff

FEATURES
* push synchronization down to atomic or equally changed
   -  more generally, tidy the sync
* memoize equality checks
* find or write external palm to XML parser and writer
* find or write external iCalendar to XML parser and writer
* Add Safari plugin
* Add the tests for plugins

USER INTERFACE
* Improve printing

OTHER PROJECTS / IDEAS

check on funding possibilities for Harmony Eclipse plug-in 

* Check "Set-Oriented Transformers," Srivastava, DBPL 2001

* Write down ideas from work with Martin at POPL

* Visualizer needs to show output even in conflict cases

* Would be really cool if even the inputs would be (re-)prettyprinted
  during typing

* Another list encoding idea: translate list to set, noting position inside data

      List of a b c  ==>  { a = 1  b = 2  c = 3 }

* Delete/delete conflicts should maybe be removed

* The n[] concrete syntax is horrible -- use n{} or n() or even just n X

* Could . in concrete syntax be replaced by <empty>?

* Rename *h etc to something else??

* Can *T be defined as X where

     X = {} | !T . X     ?
