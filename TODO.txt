THINGS TO DO

BCP TASKS
Bug: in structured text demo, try completely emptying a replica
do structured text better using spinelists
delete discussion of Makefile-based demos from quick start
make front end interpret a plain .fcl file as a check command
demos
  #   clean up all current Makefile-based demos to use new structure
  #   move instructions for some demos into separate files
some of the options (logfile, addprefsto) don't make sense for Harmony
  and should be suppressed
move Thang's general concat into List module
the code in Registry that searches for files along the search path should
  also look in subdirectories (maybe!)
why does - not work as an output file for csv (but works for meta, e.g.)?
tidy this file

We should also do the last little step to make the address demo really work
with palm data -- preprocessing the output from pilot-address to change the
first line to use numeric headers.  (No postprocess is needed because the
header line is ignored.)  I haven't done it yet because doing it right is
not entirely trivial (though pretty easy): it should really be done by
reading the file into memory as a string, but then it will *be* in memory
and the later stages of the process should be able to use it right there,
without dumping it out to a file again.

NATE TASKS
  split the svn repository

SOMEBODY
decommission and delete the /visual subdirectory
* change the structured text lens so that it adds dummy headers all the time
* expand the address book demo with a demo2, demo3, that show heterogeneous synchronization, our alignment strategy, and so on
* change implementation of sync alg to eliminate delete/delete conflicts,
  as discussed by Alan
* assertion failure should print a line number  (is this done already? I believe so)
  - make native assert function take a string arg
  - make parser recognize assert keyword specially and supply fileinfo
    as string
put LGPL notice in all files
  make sure GPL is stated correctly for CSV module

__________________________________________________________________________

TIDYING
move papers, notes, old, etc. to a separate, private svn repository
* The Sync module exports a bunch of stuff that looks internal -- is it needed
  by the sync visualizer, perhaps?  Otherwise let's drop it.
* renaming: hoist becomes hoist_unique

LENSES
* find or write external palm to XML parser and writer
* find or write external iCalendar to XML parser and writer
* get calendar lenses (ICal, ICalendar and PalmDatebook) working again
   - deal correctly with alignment (via lenses)
   - move iCalendar handling into a separate program
   - use pilotlink for datebook handling
* new primitive:  hoistAny (which acts like hoist except that it doesn't
                    care what name the edge it's clipping out has; takes a
                    default name for the put case)

SYNC ALGORITHM
* Improve printing of everything
* Delete/delete conflicts should maybe be removed
* memoize equality checks
* push synchronization down to atomic or equally changed
   -  more generally, tidy the sync algorithm

LOW PRIORITY
sync visualizer: need to show output even in conflict cases

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT LATER
* check on funding possibilities for Harmony Eclipse plug-in 
* Check "Set-Oriented Transformers," Srivastava, DBPL 2001
* Write down ideas from work with Martin at POPL
* Another list encoding idea: translate list to set, noting position inside data
      List of a b c  ==>  { a = 1  b = 2  c = 3 }
* Contact Doug Terry and Make Dahlin (UT Austin) and check out their current
  related research.  

DOCUMENTATION
move installation instructions for tidy and lablgtk2 from src/INSTALL to elsewhere
move src/INSTALL to top level

NOTE FROM MICHAEL -- HAVE WE DEALT WITH THIS?

   > I meant to ask this before: In the new INSTALL instructions for
   > OSX QUICK START it says to 
   > "set (in Makefile.conf)
   >   export INCDIRS := /sw/include"
   > First, shouldn't it say "(in OCamlMakefile)" instead of
   > Makefile.conf?
   
   Don't think so -- OCamlMakefile is something imported from outside and we
   want to be able to overwrite it with newer versions.
   
OK.  There is no file Makefile.conf in harmony4/src, and I assume
the comment wasn't for Makefile.conf in pcre --- so into which
file should we put in "export INCDIRS ..." and "export LIBDIRS
..."?  (I know what needs to be done, I just don't know where it
should be done).

HARMONY SUMMER 2005 PLANS
=========================

Major issues: 
  - finding more easy demos
  - getting the implementation really going

Major topics:  
  * Finishing Focal compiler (Nate)
      - no more research on lenses right now!
      - performance tuning
      - (eventually, replace types backend with sheaves automata to support inter, diff)
  * Rewrite visualizers in Swing or as Emacs front-ends :-)
  * Simple(!) user interface
  * Unison integration
  * Many demos
      - easy ones: bookmarks (first); bibtex (XML only!); 
        simple structured text?; iTunes? generic HTML/XML? bibtex?
          - simple XML file formats
          - no alignment issues
          - no fancy lens primitives
          - modest amounts of data
      - hard ones: 
          - calendar (make alignment into a lens!) 
            check out IETF Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group!
            redo alignment stuff as lenses
            reimplement in Focal
            however: very probably better not to deal with non-XML data at all!
                     (conversion to and from XML should be an external process, and
                      Harmony itself should not help)
            GROUP calendar demo
          - address book (vcard-ish)
              - maybe including sync'ing with cell phones
          - but make sure these don't get on the critical path!
      - maybe some of the driver scripts should be written in Perl/Python
  * Packaging and configuration
      - no backups
  * Documentation
      - documentation of lenses should be generated from source code (both ocaml
        and focal)
