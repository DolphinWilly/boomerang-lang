<n>** SECOND ADDRESS BOOK DEMO</n>
<note>*

This demo illustrates some variations in the treatment of names.  Names are
recognized in several different formats: given/family, family-only,
given-only, and "bare name" (just text immediately inside the n tag).
In the abstract tree, all of these are transformed into the same
format: the whole abstract address book consists of a bush whose immediate
child edges are last names, whose grandchild edges are first names, and
whose great-grand-trees are the remaining information in each address
record.  Look at the records below and observe how each one is reflected in
the abstract tree in the other window.

Do [make demo3] when you're ready.
