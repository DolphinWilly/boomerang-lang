    <n><family>** THE ADDRESS BOOK DEMO **</family></n>
    <note>The first address book demo illustrates very simple address book synchronization.

Try changing the text in the tel-home tag of the first entry in one replica
(the file r1.xml) and the tel-work tag of the second entry in the other
(r2.xml). Then do [make demo] to see what happens. (Or, if you are reading this
in an editor that was created automatically by a [make demo1], just save the
files and quit the editor; the new files will be synchronized and redisplayed
for further editing.  The demo will automatically repeat as long as you keep
changing one of the files in the editor.  If you change neither file, the demo
terminates.)  Repeat as desired.

You can also try changing the files in other sorts of ways to see what happens.
If you get things into a state that you do not understand and want to start
fresh, do [make demo1] to reinitialize the demo.
