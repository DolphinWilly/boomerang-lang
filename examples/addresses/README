HARMONIZE-ADDRESSES -- a Harmony instance for Palm and xcard address files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN SHORTCOMINGS

* Only a subset of the fields in the current Palm address format are
  handled; birthdays, pictures, etc. are not synchronized

* Fields containing semicolons in Palm files are not handled
  correctly.  The problem here comes from the pilot-addresses tool,
  which uses semicolons incorrectly.  In one place, it follows the
  standard CSV convention that a field containing a semicolon, like
  X;YZ, should be formatted as "X";"YZ".  (Specifically, it uses this
  format to recognize "augmented fields" consisting of a phone number
  label such as Home, Work, etc., plus a phone number.)  But in other
  places it ignores this convention and expects X;YZ, to be formatted
  as "X;YZ".  It is not clear how to correct this without changing
  pilot-addresses or introducing a hideous special-purpose hack in our
  CSV writing code.

INSTALLATION AND USAGE NOTES

* Grab latest pilot-link from www.pilot-link.org and build it
  something like this:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME
    make
    make install

* Create a directory for storing the local proxy of the palm addresses
  and the archive file -- e.g.

        mkdir ~/palmarchives

* Now we're ready to harmonize (assuming your addresses are currently
  living on your palm)...

-------------------
STEPS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SYNC 

   cd ~/palmarchives
   # copy addresses from palm to local proxy
   pilot-addresses -a --write=addresses.csv
   # make a backup, for the sake of paranoia
   cp addresses.xml backup-addresses.xml-`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
   cp addresses.csv backup-addresses.csv-`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
   # Run harmony
   harmonize-addresses addresses.xml addresses.csv
   # Put them back on the palm
   pilot-addresses --delete-all
   pilot-addresses -a --read=addresses.csv

Repeat as desired.
