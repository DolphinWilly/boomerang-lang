INSTALLATION AND USAGE NOTES

* Grab latest pilot-link from www.pilot-link.org and build it
  something like this:

    ./configure --prefix=$HOME
    make
    make install

* Create a file of xcard addresses and put it somewhere.  Mine is
  ~/current/z/addresses.txt.  (Yes, I know that's a strange extension
  for an xml file.)  If you want to create a fresh one, it
  should look like this:

     <xcard></xcard>

* Create a directory for storing the local proxy of the palm addresses
  and the archive file -- e.g.

        mkdir ~/palmarchives

-------------------
STEPS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SYNC 

   cd ~/palmarchives
   # copy addresses from palm to local proxy
   pilot-addresses -a --write=addresses.csv
   # make a backup, for the sake of paranoia
   cp ~/current/z/addresses.txt backup-addresses.txt-`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
   cp ~/current/z/addresses.csv backup-addresses.csv-`date +%y%m%d-%H%M%S`
   # Run harmony
   harmonize-addresses ~/current/z/addresses.txt addresses.csv
   # Put them back on the palm
   pilot-addresses --delete-all
   pilot-addresses -a --read=addresses.csv
