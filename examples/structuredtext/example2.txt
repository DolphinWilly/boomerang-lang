* STRUCTURED TEXT DEMO 

This time, instead of synchronizing a structured text file (r1.txt) with
another one (r2.txt), we're showing the "abstract tree" (r2.meta) that
results from applying the structured text lens to a concrete structured text
file (r1.txt).  

The "meta" suffix indicates that the second replica is stored as a simple
textual dump of Harmony's internal tree representation.  During
synchronization, the lens applied to the file r2.meta is the identity lens
-- i.e., r2.meta stores exactly the abstract tree obtained from r1.txt.  You
can see that the abstract schema for synchronizing simple structured text
files consists of a list of blocks, where each block is a itself a list
whose first element is a header line.

You can edit r1.txt, re-run the demo (by either re-doing 'make demo' or just
saving the files and quitting the editor, as appropriate), and see the
effects on the abstract tree.  

Try this now: add a new section header (a line beginning with a star) and
see where it winds up in the abstract tree.  (Deleting all this text from
the first block may help to see the structure.)

Then do 'make demo3' to go on to the next step.
