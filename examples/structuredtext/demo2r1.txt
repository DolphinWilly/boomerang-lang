* STRUCTURED TEXT DEMO 

This time, instead of synchronizing one structured text file with another
one, we're showing the "abstract tree" that results from applying the
structured text lens to a concrete structured text file.

The second replica is stored as a simple textual dump of Harmony's internal
tree representation.  During synchronization, the lens applied to the file
(called r2.meta) is the identity lens -- i.e., r2.meta stores exactly the
abstract tree obtained from r1.txt.  You can see that the abstract schema
for synchronizing simple structured text files consists of a list of blocks,
where each block is a itself a list whose first element is a header line.

Try this now: add a new section header (a line beginning with a star) to the
first replica and see where it winds up in the abstract tree.  (Deleting all
this text from the first block may help to see the structure.)

Then go on to the third part of the demo.
