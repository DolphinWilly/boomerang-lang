* THE STRUCTURED TEXT DEMO

This first example of structured text synchronization illustrates the basic
ideas with just one level of structure.

Try adding a few new lines below SECOND PART in one replica (the file
r1.txt) and below the THIRD PART in the other (r2.txt).  Then do 'make demo'
to see what happens. (Or, if you're reading this in an editor that was
created automatically by a 'make demo1', just save the files and quit the
editor; the new files will be synchronized and redisplayed for further
editing.  The demo will automatically repeat as long as you keep changing
one of the files in the editor.  If you change neither file, the demo
terminates.)  Repeat as desired.

You can also try changing the files in other sorts of ways to see what
happens.  If you get things into a state that you don't understand and want
to start fresh, do 'make demo1' to reinitialize the demo.

When you're ready, do 'make demo2' to go on to the next step.
