* THE STRUCTURED TEXT DEMO

This first example of structured text synchronization illustrates the basic
ideas with just one level of structure.

Try adding a few new lines below SECOND PART in one replica (the file
r1.txt) and below the THIRD PART in the other (r2.txt).  Then do 'make demo'
to see what happens (or, if you're reading this in an editor that was
created automatically by a 'make demo1', just save the files and quit the
editor; the new files will be synchronized and redisplayed for further
editing).  Repeat if desired.

You can also try changing the files in other sorts of way and doing 'make
demo' to see what happens.  If you get things into a state that you don't
understand and want to start fresh, do 'make demo1' to reinitialize the
demo.

When you're ready, do 'make demo2' to go on to the next step.


* SECOND PART

* THIRD PART
