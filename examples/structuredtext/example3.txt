For this demo, we are using a more sophisticated lens to map from the
concrete text file to the abstract tree.  (This is achieved by dropping the
-simplified flag on the command line to harmonize-structuredtext, which
causes the lens Structuredtext.file_with_combined_headers to be used instead
of Structuredtext.file_with_simple_star_headers, as can be seen by a quick
look at harmonize-structuredtext.ml.  These lenses, in turn, are defined in
the Focal source file structuredtext.fcl -- this involves some pretty tricky
lens programming, though, so don't be discouraged if that file doesn't make
much sense right now.)

Notice that there are now four levels of headers; lines beginning with one,
two, and three stars, and then lines with no stars but consisting entirely
of capital letters and spaces.  

Note, also, that levels can be "skipped" -- e.g., this text is not preceded
by any header lines at all.  In this case, empty headers for all the missing
levels are automatically inserted.

Try editing the abstract tree and changing the first "" header to a "* FOO"
(don't forget the space after the star).  See what happens when the abstract
tree is pushed back down into the concrete text format.

Do 'make demo4' when you are ready to go on.
