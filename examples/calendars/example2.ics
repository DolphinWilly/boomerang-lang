DESCRIPTION:Now\, let's take a look at how iCalendar files are encoded into our
  native meta format. \n\nThis file consists in exactly the same
  event as in the demo1 (except this very note\, of course)\, and
  you can see how the data is rearranged in r2.meta. The abstract view
  is a bush where the entries are sorted with respect to their type
  (here\, we only have one entry of sort Eventc\, so the other sorts
  do not appear). In each sort\, the entries are keyed under an unique
  identifier\, that is part of the iCalendar specification. This uuid
  is the cornerstone of our system\, since it is a convenient and
  easy way to align the entries between two files\, without considering
  their relative order.\n\nTo illustrate the importance of this uuid
 \, try forcing to uuid in both files to something different\, and
  close the editor. What will happen is that Harmony will not find
  the old key (the only one present in the replica) in either file\,
  and will therefore assume that it has been deleted from both replicas
 . On the other hand\, each file will contain a new entry that does
  not exist on the other side\, so both entries (though equal besides
  their uuids) will be added to the archive as completely separate
  entries.
