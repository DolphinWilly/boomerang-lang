DESCRIPTION:Now\, if you looked carefully at the first demo\, you may have noticed
  that even if you were just modifying the location of the event in
  the second replica\, the changes done in the first replica by the
  harmonizer were involving a change to the LAST-MODIFIED property.
  If you haven't\, well\, you are welcome to try with the current
  file :-) Indeed\, the synchronizer detects updates to an entry thanks
  to a special primitive lens\, and updates the date as appropriate
  using calls to the Unix 'date' command. For this reason\, the LAST
 -MODIFIED is not kept in the abstract view\, as you can see in the
  view below\, since it must not be part of the synchronized data.\n
 \nNote that if you modify only one replica\, the last-modified property
  is not updated by the synchronizer in the entry that you manually
  modified. Indeed\, you should have done that yourself when making
  changes to your calendar\, and that's what any organizer would do
  if you were not editing this file manually.\n\nWhen you are done
  experimenting with lastmods\, proceed to the demo3 to see another
  similar issue that we faced when developing this calendar synchronizer
 .
