make:
    - vcard.vcf => vcard.xml (change format de vcard from vcf to xml)
    - using harmony:(the lens l in lens.fcl)
	+ in get direction: take the concrete view "vcard.xml" and return 
 	                    the view outget.meta
	+ in put direction: take the abstract view "newabstract.meta" and
	                    return the view output.xml	
    - output.xml => newvcard.vcf 

In conclusion, we have the new vcard.

Remark: to make clean, use "make clean_all" (I use make clean_all to 
	distinguish with "make clean" in Common)
