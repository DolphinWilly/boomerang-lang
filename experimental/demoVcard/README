Use:

  "make"         :  to synchronize vcard1.xml and vcard1.vcf
  "make xml-xml" :  to synchronize vcard1.xml and vcard2.xml
  "make vcf-vcf" :  to synchronize vcard1.vcf and vcard2.vcf

Add lensOrg to lens.fcl. It resolves the synchronization between the kinds:
	 ORG = {ORGNAME = a, (ORGUNIT = b)*} and  ORG = `Value

Remark: in newabstract, if there is only one element in ORG (it means only
ORGNAME appear in the new abstract), it's written with semicolon,e.g: "name;" (not "name")

It's very fast now (by translate a view {?n1 = V,...,?nk = V} to {info = V} ).
We can apply this technique in case that the tree has a huge number of nodes in 
a same level.

It takes about 11 minutes in "make" and "make xml-xml", about 5 minutes in "make vcf-vcf"  
(It's so slow because of the schema of vCard; I don't like it :-) )

Resume the process of demoVcard:
 _ According to the definition of vCard in xml, its format is not a view. 
   The lexer xml2view.mll translates this format to a view (in the format xml). 
    For exmaple: in the original vCard, it could have two keyword of the same name 
                 "TEL" (in the same depth of tree) so it is not a view. The lexer 
	         combines all subtrees of two "TEL" to a subtree of only "TEL":
                    {..., TEL = tree1, ..., TEL = tree2, ... } 
	   	  => { ..., TEL = {tree1, tree2}, ...}
   The lexer view2xml.mll does the contrary.
 
 _ The lexers vcf2xml.mll and xml2vcf translate the format vcf to xml and xml to vcf 
   respectively.  

 _ In the module Lens, I use two new lens: to_list and "general" concat (Remark: in 
   the lens concat I change character space (" ") bettwen 2 lists by character semicolon 
   because it's more appropriate when we synchronize xml and vcf). The lenses "vcf" and 
   "xml" change vCard in each format to the view of schema Vcard that I define in schemas.fcl
 
 _ I write the schema Vcard less general than the definition of vCard in condition of speed.
   I keep all the field I think it's important or more general in both format. If you want,
   you can add any field (I've defined in the same file) to the schema Vcard. Certainly, it 
   makes the process of synchronization slower.
