STYLE GUIDELINES FOR HARMONY CODEBASE
=====================================

PRINTING

  - ALL output goes via the low-level formatting function Util.format.
    Nothing goes directly to stdout (e.g., Printf.printf), or to the
    standard stdout formatter (Format.printf).  Nothing from Format is
    called directly.  Nothing goes to stderr, except very special things
    like usage messages which are going to be followed by an exit.

  - Util.msg (from ubase) sends things to stderr, so it should not be used
    either

SOME MORE DETAILED NOTES ON HOW PRINTING WORKS IN HARMONY

There are lots of different primitives for displaying stuff:

  - Format.printf

      Used all over the place, both in regular printing and in debugging code

  - Printf.printf (and similar stuff involving stdout)

      Not used, except for Misc.write in case its argument is "-" (which
      seems OK).  

  - Printf.eprintf (and similar stuff involving stderr) and Util.msg, which
    prints to stderr using Uprintf module.

      Printf.eprintf is used by the Uargs module for dumping usage
      information, just before exiting.  This is probably OK.

  - Format.eprintf

      Not used
