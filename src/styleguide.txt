STYLE GUIDELINES FOR HARMONY CODEBASE
=====================================

PRINTING

  - ALL output goes to stdout via a formatting stream (e.g., Format.printf).
    Nothing goes directly to stdout (e.g., Printf.printf).  Nothing goes to
    stderr, except very special things like usage messages which are going
    to be followed by an exit.

  - Util.msg (from ubase) sends things to stderr, so it should not be used

  - Format.print_newline and Format.print_flush both close all open boxes;
    they should *never* be called by Harmony (except at the very end at the
    top level, just before exiting).  Ditto Format.printf "... \n ..."
    (we're not actually sure what this does, but it doesn't seem to play
    nice).

    Format.force_newline and Format.printf "... @\n ..." are OK.

SOME MORE DETAILED NOTES ON HOW PRINTING WORKS IN HARMONY

There are lots of different primitives for displaying stuff:

  - Format.printf

      Used all over the place, both in regular printing and in debugging code

  - Printf.printf (and similar stuff involving stdout)

      Not used, except for Misc.write in case its argument is "-" (which
      seems OK).  

  - Printf.eprintf (and similar stuff involving stderr) and Util.msg, which
    prints to stderr using Uprintf module.

      Printf.eprintf is used by the Uargs module for dumping usage
      information, just before exiting.  This is probably OK.

  - Format.eprintf

      Not used
