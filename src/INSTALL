HARMONY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------

BUILDING HARMONY

To install harmony, you'll need the following packages.  They are
specified here in the order in which they should be installed.

[Note: If you get tangled up and need to start this process again,
make sure that, at each step, you first do 'make uninstall' to remove
the previous version.]

GNU make    Should already be installed on most systems these days

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html.  
            OCaml 3.07 or later is needed for the Focal visualizer.  3.06 should work  
            for the core system.

            QUICK START ON OSX:
              sudo fink install ocaml

lablgtk2    It is required by the lens visualizer (not the synchronizer).
	    http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
	    Versions >= 2.2 are working.
	    To install it properly you may need some Pango, Gnome and
	    Glade libraries.
	    
	    QUICK START
	    ./configure; make world; make opt; sudo make install; make clean

findlib     versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 has been tested.
	    findlib can be downloaded from
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START:
              ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install; make clean

pcre        Phil Hazel's PCRE library, version >= 4.1.  
	    Tested with 4.2 and 4.5.
            http://www.pcre.org
            (PCRE is a common package, so it might already be installed on
            your system.  On OSX, 'fink install pcre' might work, but be 
            careful that it gets you a recent enough version!  Otherwise...) 

            QUICK START: 
              ./configure; make; sudo make install

pcre-ocaml  http://www.ai.univie.ac.at/~markus/home/ocaml_sources.html.  Get
            5.02 or later (tested with 5.09).

            QUICK START FOR OSX: 
                make STATIC=1; sudo make install STATIC=1

ocamlnet    http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version from 0.95 to 0.98.
            
            QUICK START: 
               cd src; ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

            IMPORTANT: there is a bug in versions <=0.95.
            In src/netstring/nethtml.ml, line 130, change
              ... `Elements["dl"; "dd"] ..
            to
              ... `Elements["dt"; "dd"] ..
            before compiling.
            HARMONY WILL ONLY WORK WITH THIS FIX!

pxp         Tested with version 1.1.5.
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START: 
                ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

tidylib	    This is a common package that may be already in your
	    system. The headers tidy.h and tidyenum.h are especially
	    required.
	    http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
	    There are RPMs, debs for the major Linux distributions.

	    QUICK START:
		sudo fink install tidy
		cd build/gmake; make; sudo make install


That's it!  Only 9 dependencies!

Now, simply type 'make', follow any instructions you see, and you should
end up with a harmony binary and the lens programming environment visual.
