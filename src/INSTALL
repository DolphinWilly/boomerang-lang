HARMONY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------

BUILDING HARMONY

To install harmony, you'll need the following packages.  They are
specified here in the order in which they should be installed.

[Note: If you get tangled up and need to start this process again,
make sure that, at each step, you first do 'make uninstall' to remove
the previous version.]

GNU make    Should already be installed on most systems these days

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html.  
            OCaml 3.07 or later is needed for the Focal visualizer.  3.06 should work  
            for the core system.

            QUICK START ON OSX:
              sudo fink install ocaml

findlib     versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 have been tested.
	    findlib can be downloaded from
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START:
              ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install; make clean

pcre        Phil Hazel's PCRE library, version >= 4.1.  
	    Tested with 4.2 and 4.5.
            http://www.pcre.org

            OSX QUICK START:
              fink install pcre

              (Note that installing pcre using Fink means that pcre is
              installed in a ``non-standard place'', and your
              pcre-ocaml installation below must follow the
              corresponding instructions.)

            QUICK START: 
              ./configure; make; sudo make install

pcre-ocaml  http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html
            Get version 5.02 or later (tested with 5.09).

            QUICK START FOR OSX: 
                make STATIC=1; sudo make install STATIC=1

ocamlnet    http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version from 0.95 to 0.98.
            
            QUICK START: 
               cd src; ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

pxp         Tested with version 1.1.5.
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START: 
                ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

That's it!  Only 6 dependencies!

Now, simply type 'make' and you should end up with a harmony binary.
Type 'make test' and you should see all the regression tests run.


----------------------------------------
OTHER DEPENDENCIES FOR CERTAIN NON-CRITICAL PARTS OF THE HARMONY DISTRIBUTION

lablgtk2    It is required by the lens visualizer (not the synchronizer).
	    http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
	    Versions >= 2.2 are working.
	    To install it properly you may need some Pango, Gnome and
	    Glade libraries.
	    
	    QUICK START
	    ./configure; make world; make opt; sudo make install; make clean

            On OSX, we've had some problems with package dependencies,
            especially under Fink.  Things seem to go much better
            under Darwinports.  (Just do "sudo ports install lablgtk2"!)

tidy	    This is a common package that may be already in your
	    system. 

	    http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

	    There are RPMs, debs for the major Linux distributions.

            QUICK START:
		cd build/gmake; make; sudo make install

	    QUICK START FOR OSX:
		sudo fink install tidy
