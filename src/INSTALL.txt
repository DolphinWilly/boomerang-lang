HARMONY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------------------

GODI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The simplest way to install the prerequisites needed by Harmony is via the
Godi package manager for OCaml.  

Download godi from http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/
Follow installation instructions.  Then do:

godi_console perform -build godi-ocaml-all
godi_console perform -build godi-pxp

Now go to the directory where you unpacked the Harmony tarball, type 'make',
and you should end up with a harmony binary in the /src directory (as well
as binaries for each instance XXX in examples/XXX).  Type 'make test' and
you should see all the regression tests run.

BUILDING HARMONY BY HAND

To install Harmony's prerequisites individually, you'll need the following
packages.  They are specified here in the order in which they should be
installed.

[Note: If you get tangled up and need to start this process again,
make sure that, at each step, you first do 'make uninstall' or
whatever to remove the previous version.]

GNU make    Should already be installed on most systems these days

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html.  
            OCaml 3.07 or later is needed.

            QUICK START ON OSX:
              sudo fink install ocaml

findlib     versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 have been tested.
	    findlib can be downloaded from
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START:
              ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install; make clean

pcre        http://www.pcre.org
            Tested with version 4.5.

            OSX QUICK START:
              fink install pcre

            (Note that installing pcre using Fink means that pcre is
              installed in a ``non-standard place'', and your
              pcre-ocaml installation below must follow the
              corresponding instructions.)

            QUICK START FOR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS: 
              ./configure; make; sudo make install

pcre-ocaml  http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html
            Tested with version 5.09

            QUICK START FOR OSX: 
                make STATIC=1; sudo make install STATIC=1

              If you used Fink to install pcre, then you will need to add the lines
                  export INCDIRS := /sw/include
                  export LIBDIRS := /sw/lib
               to Makefile.conf before doing this.

            (For other operating systems, you may or may not need the STATIC=1 stuff.)

equeue      http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version 2.1.3

            QUICK START: 
               ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

ocamlnet    http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version 1.1.1
            
            QUICK START: 
               cd src; ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

pxp         Tested with version 1.1.5.
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

            QUICK START: 
                ./configure; make all opt; sudo make install

That's it!  Only seven dependencies!

Now, simply type 'make' and you should end up with a harmony binary.
Type 'make test' and you should see all the regression tests run.


----------------------------------------
OTHER DEPENDENCIES FOR CERTAIN NON-CRITICAL PARTS OF THE HARMONY DISTRIBUTION

lablgtk2    It is required by the lens visualizer (not the synchronizer).
	    http://wwwfun.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soft/olabl/lablgtk.html
	    Versions >= 2.2 are working.
	    To install it properly you may need some Pango, Gnome and
	    Glade libraries.
	    
	    QUICK START
	    ./configure; make world; make opt; sudo make install; make clean

            On OSX, we've had some problems with package dependencies,
            especially under Fink.  Things seem to go much better
            under Darwinports.  (Just do "sudo ports install lablgtk2"!)

tidy	    This is a common package that may be already in your
	    system. 

	    http://tidy.sourceforge.net/

	    There are RPMs, debs for the major Linux distributions.

            QUICK START:
		cd build/gmake; make; sudo make install

	    QUICK START FOR OSX:
		sudo fink install tidy
