DESCRIPTION:This demo shows how Harmony can be used to synchronize calendar files
  between organizers that use the iCalendar format (e.g.\, iCal on
  MacOS/X\, Evolution or kOrganizer on Linux systems\, Outlook on
  Win32).\n\nA calendar file in iCalendar format is a list of entries
  of different sorts\, like events\, to-dos\, and other less frequently
  used kinds of entries. This file consists in a single event entry
  occuring on Aug\, 10th\, 2005\, between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM.
  Try to modify the location or title of the event in this file or
  the one below\, and close your editor to see how the files will
  be synchronized by Harmony. You can do that as many times as desired
 . If you wish to end the demo\, just call your editor with the files
  unchanged. When you are done\, proceed to the next step by typing
  [make demo2].\n\nNB : When adding text directly to an iCalendar
  file\, pay attention to the special characters like comma or semi-colon
 \, who should be escaped. For an idea of which characters ought to
  be escaped\, take a look at this text. Also\, an iCalendar file
  must not be wider than 75 colums\, and each line beginning with
  exactly one white space is parsed as the following of the previous
  line. Again\, take a look at how this note is laid out in this file
 .
