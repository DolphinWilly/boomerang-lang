			    PresTAF Library
			    ===============

1) Pre-requisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile PresTAF you have to install the C Common Library of the
AltaRica Project and the Shared-Automata library (SATAF) . These libraries can 
be found respectively at http://altarica.labri.fr/Tools/ccl/ and 
http://altarica.labri.fr/Tools/sataf/.

This software has been developed on a Fedora Core 4 platform but we hope that
compilation scripts will work on other platform. It will be easier to compile
the tool if your platform possesses GNU development tools. 

If you are interested by the documentation of the source code you will need
Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org).


2) Compilation and Installation instructions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If all work as expected, you just have to execute:
./do-build --make-install

This command will compile PresTAF and install it (by default) into the 
directory $HOME/mvtsi-dev/. To specify another installation director, use the 
option --install-dir, e.g:
./do-build --make-install --install-dir ~/i/prefer/this/one

The script assumes that, at least, the prefix of the given directory exists 
(for the example ~/i/prefer/this).

Unless it has been installed in a standard directory (e.g /usr/local), the 
script uses the installation directory to look for the CCL and SATAF 
libraries. 

The script creates a directory ./build/<OS>-<CPU> where <OS> is the name of
your OS and <CPU> the name ... of your CPU. This directory is used to store
all tempory files (e.g. .o file) and the the 'libprestaf' library. If the 
compilation process doesn't work properly or if you want to tune it, you
can modify the generated Makefile located in ./build/<OS>-<CPU>.

3) Contacts and Bug reporting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You may contact maintainers of the software by sending a mail to 
altarica-admin@labri.fr. A Bugzilla web site http://altarica.labri.fr/bugs/
can be used to report bugs.
