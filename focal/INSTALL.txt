 | HARMONY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS |
 +-----------------------------------+

To install Harmony's prerequisites individually, you'll need several
packages.  These can either be installed using GODI (suggested method)
or manually (only slightly more difficult).

 +--------------------------------+
 | GODI INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS |
 +--------------------------------+

The simplest way to install the prerequisites needed by Harmony is via
the Godi package manager for OCaml. Download godi from

  http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/ 

Follow installation instructions.  Then issue the commands:

  godi_console perform -build godi-ocaml-all
  godi_console perform -build godi-pxp
  godi_console perform -build godi-omake

Now go to the directory where you unpacked the Harmony tarball, type 'omake',
and you should end up with a harmony binary in the /src directory (as well
as binaries for each instance XXX in examples/XXX).

They are specified here in the order in which they should be
installed.

[Note: If you get tangled up and need to start this process again,
make sure that, at each step, you first do 'make uninstall' or
whatever to remove the previous version.]

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html.  
            OCaml 3.09 or later is needed.

OMake       http://omake.metaprl.org/

findlib     versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 have been tested.
	    findlib can be downloaded from
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

pcre        http://www.pcre.org
            Tested with version 4.5.

            (Note that installing pcre using Fink means that pcre is
              installed in a ``non-standard place'', and your
              pcre-ocaml installation below must follow the
              corresponding instructions.)

pcre-ocaml  http://www.ocaml.info/home/ocaml_sources.html
            Tested with version 5.09

              If you used Fink to install pcre, then you will need to add the lines
                  export INCDIRS := /sw/include
                  export LIBDIRS := /sw/lib
               to Makefile.conf before doing this.

equeue      http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version 2.1.3

ocamlnet    http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/
            Tested with version 1.1.1
            
pxp         Tested with version 1.1.5.
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

That's it!  Only seven dependencies!

Now, simply type 'omake' and you should end up with a harmony binary.
