 | BOOMERANG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS |
 +-------------------------------------+

To build Boomerang from source, you need OCaml and OMake.  These can
either be installed using GODI (suggested method) or manually (only
slightly more difficult).

 | BUILDING WITH GODI |
 +--------------------+

The easiest way to install the prerequisites needed by Boomerang is
via the GODI package manager for OCaml. There are four steps:

1. Download GODI from:

  http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/get_godi.html

2. Next, follow the GODI installation instructions in the included
   README file.

3. Next, issue the following two commands:
 
  godi_console perform -build godi-ocaml-all
  godi_console perform -build godi-omake

4. Finally, go to the trunk directory of the Boomerang distribution
   and type 'omake'. After the build completes, you should end up with
   a working binary in the bin directory.

 | BUILDING BY HAND |
 +------------------+

The required resources are specified here in the order in which they should
be installed.

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/download.en.html
            OCaml 3.09 or later is needed.

OMake       http://omake.metaprl.org/

findlib     http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html
            versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 have been tested.

Go to the trunk directory of the Boomerang distribution and type
'omake'. After the build completes, you should end up with a working
binary in the bin directory.
