 | BOOMERANG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS |
 +-------------------------------------+

To build Boomerang from source, you need OCaml and OMake.  These can
either be installed using GODI (suggested method) or manually (only
slightly more difficult).

 +--------------------+
 | BUILDING WITH GODI |
 +--------------------+

The simplest way to install the prerequisites needed by Boomerang is
via the Godi package manager for OCaml. Download godi from

  http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/

Follow installation instructions.  Then issue the commands:
 
  godi_console perform -build godi-ocaml-all
  godi_console perform -build godi-omake

Now go to the boomerang directory, type 'omake', and you should end up
with a boomerang binary in the bin directory.

 +------------------+
 | BUILDING BY HAND |
 +------------------+

The required resources are specified here in the order in which they should
be installed.

[Note: If you get tangled up and need to start this process again, make sure
that, at each step, you first do 'make uninstall' or whatever to remove the
previous version.]

ocaml       http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/distrib.html.  
            OCaml 3.09 or later is needed.

OMake       http://omake.metaprl.org/

findlib     versions from 0.8.1 to 1.0.4 have been tested.
	    findlib can be downloaded from
            http://www.ocaml-programming.de/packages/

Now simply type 'omake' in the top-level boomerang directory and you should
end up with a boomerang binary in the bin directory.
