== BUILD == 

* add target for bytecode compilation (Nate)

== SYSTEM ==

* -check-only flag: don't compile and run, just check that base sorts
  line up.

* re-do lens printing entirely

* better error messages on bad overloading resolution (usually caused by a type issue elsewhere)

* optimization and speedups (profiling indicates lots of GC activity)

* functions to process command-line arguments from boomerang (e.g., set solutions mode for coqsplit)

== LIBRARIES == 

* Investigate other options for the contract on sorting.

* Work out standardized WS/WSP/NL* regexps

* Fix contract on q-lenses using crel/arel/cnrel.

* Various ISO formats, e.g. ISO8601 dates 
** http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874

* Encodings and numbes: Base64, hex, scientific notation
** can we write a lens in hex <-> decimal?  which primitives must we add, if any?

== DOCUMENTATION ==

* Polish intro of manual.

* Add examples using q-lenses to QuickStart.

* Add description of sync.
