  HARMONY: A FRAMEWORK FOR DEFINING, UPDATING, AND SYNCHRONIZING VIEWS

                 http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony

OVERVIEW
-------

Views are usually discussed in the context of databases, but actually
appear in a host of applications across many diverse areas of
computing.  In many application, is necessary to apply an update to
the view, and have that update be reflected on the source.
Unfortunately, the view update problem remains largely unsolved;
except in very simple cases, views are read-only.  Our goal is to
develop languages in which programmers can specify both how to
calculate a view, and how to translate updates to a view back to the
source. We call these bidirectional programs lenses.

This directory contains the sources for Harmony itself, together with
a collection of sample instances that define updatable views over a
variety of specific data formats.

GETTING STARTED
---------------

Harmony consists of two similar but distinct source trees.

* Boomerang: our current work is focused on a lens language for string
  data. To get started with see the QuickStart file in
  boomerang/QuickStart.src.

* Focal: previously we developed lenses and synchronization algorithms
  for trees and relations. See the Quick Start chapter in the Harmony
  Programmer's Manual (doc/manual.pdf). (If you want to get started
  compiling things right away and read while that is chugging away,
  have a look at src/INSTALL.)
