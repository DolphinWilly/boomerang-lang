HARMONY: A GENERIC SYNCHRONIZATION FRAMEWORK
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/harmony


OVERVIEW
-------

Increased reliance on optimistic data replication has led to
burgeoning interest in tools and frameworks for synchronizing
disconnected updates to replicated data.  To better understand the
issues underlying the design of generic and heterogeneous
synchronizers, we have implemented an experimental framework, called
Harmony, that can be used to build synchronizers for tree-structured
data stored in a variety of concrete formats, in particular XML.
