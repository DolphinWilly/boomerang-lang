HARMONY: A GENERIC SYNCHRONIZATION FRAMEWORK
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/harmony


OVERVIEW
-------

Increased reliance on optimistic data replication has led to
burgeoning interest in tools and frameworks for synchronizing
disconnected updates to replicated data.  To better understand the
issues underlying the design of generic and heterogeneous
synchronizers, we have implemented an experimental framework, called
Harmony, that can be used to build synchronizers for tree-structured
data stored in a variety of concrete formats, in particular XML.

This directory contains the sources for Harmony itself, together with
a collection of sample Harmony instances that can be used to
synchronize a variety of specific data formats.

See the Quick Start chapter in the Harmony Programmer's Manual
(doc/manual.pdf).  (If you want to get started compiling things right
away and read while that is chugging away, have a look at
src/INSTALL.)
