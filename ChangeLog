CHANGES FROM VERSION 1667$

Fixed ChangeLog so that versioning info gets added to commit messages. 

This is a little bit useless because (a) we don't have a numbering scheme beyond SVN revision #s and (b) those #s are global for the whole repository, not just for trunk, so they won't always be consecutive. However, they give folks a reference for changes to trunk.
